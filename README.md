# Resume-Generator
-Designed and developed a web portal using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap to make a primary resume generator that takes relevant data from the user without any complex code to generate a resume.

-Features include various subsections of the resume like basic information, including uploading a profile photo, and accommodates as many points as required by the user, followed by printing/saving in a pdf format.

-HTML is used for making the initial block structure of the page with some simple data, CSS is used for giving some style to the page, and JS is used to create small UI components dynamically and fill the data into the page.
